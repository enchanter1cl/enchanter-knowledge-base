*   [x] **Script to Always Start Play Mode from the PersistentManagers scene.**

    Ensures Unity automatically loads `PersistentManagers` scene before entering Play Mode, regardless of the currently open scene.

    For example:

    If you are working in the `CharacterChoose` scene and enter Play Mode, only the `PersistentManagers` and `MainMenu` scenes will be loaded in the Hierarchy.

    When you exit Play Mode, the editor will return to the original scene (`CharacterChoose`) as it was before.
